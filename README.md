# Automated UI Tests Generated by AI

This repository contains automated UI tests for web pages using test cases generated by AI.

The test cases were generated based on the following prompt:

- **Step 1:** "Write test case for \<action> on web page \<web-page>"

The UI tests were then written using the following technologies and patterns:

- **Step 2:** "Thanks! Based on this test case, please write a UI test with \<programming-language> and \<ui-library> with test data generation and extract test data to separate the data class. Also, use the Page Object pattern and CSS selectors in the format "\<selector-format>""

The following libraries were used in the UI tests:

- **Step 3:** "Please write \<builder> dependency for \<library>"

## Getting Started

To run the UI tests, you will need to have the following installed on your system:

- \<programming-language> (e.g. Java, Kotlin)
- \<ui-library> (e.g. Selenium, Selenide)
- \<builder> for \<library> (e.g. Gradle for Selenium, Maven for Selenide)

## Running the Tests

To run the UI tests, navigate to the project directory and run the following command:

```shell
./gradlew test
```

This will run all the UI tests in the project. You can also run individual tests using your IDE's test runner.
